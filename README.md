This repo contains the source code of the Twitter [@GramtionBot](https://twitter.com/GramtionBot) for generating photo descriptions.  
Use cases and intends: 
* Help visually impaired Twitter users. 
Good image descriptions (alt text) will help them understand what is happening in an image. 
Instagram and Facebook use deep learning for image captioning. 
Twitter users can only add custom alt text descriptions themselves. 
Automation of alt text generation will help Twitter be more accessible. 
* Collect dataset for image captioning (if it's legal, I don't know now). 
Annotations can be done by creating polls about prediction quality and getting corrected descriptions from users. 
Twitter API v1.1 has not the ability to create polls, but it will be added to API v2. 

## How to use

Tweet photo with mention [@GramtionBot](https://twitter.com/GramtionBot) or reply with mention to a tweet with a photo and the bot will send you an auto-generated image description.

Links to [example 1](https://twitter.com/GramtionBot/status/1318674709874118656) and [example 2](https://twitter.com/snoWhite_tan/status/963953292383580165) tweets.

## Dependencies

Gramtion is mostly made from ready parts:
* Image captioning model taken from [self-critical.pytorch](https://github.com/ruotianluo/self-critical.pytorch)
* Bot written with [Tweepy](https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy)
* Configuration settings implemented with [pydantic](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/).

## Current issues 

* The model can only handle photographs, for other types of images prediction are quite random.
* Not sure if the current bot interface is comfortable for visually impaired users.
* Some descriptions can be confusing. Waiting for Twitter API v2, which will add the ability to create polls to rate the descriptions.
* Some results may reflect inherent gender and racial biases of open datasets.

## Run own bot

To run an instance of the bot you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and create [Twitter API auth credentials](https://realpython.com/twitter-bot-python-tweepy/#creating-twitter-api-authentication-credentials).  
If you have a Twitter developer account, but don't want to use it as a bot account, you can authenticate a new user thatâ€™s not has a developer account with [twurl](https://github.com/twitter/twurl).

* Create .env file with credentials. 

    ```
    CONSUMER_KEY={{ consumer_key }}
    CONSUMER_SECRET={{ consumer_secret }}
    ACCESS_TOKEN={{ access_token }}
    ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET={{ access_token_secret }}
    ```

* Run Docker container with running the bot  

    ```bash
    docker run -d --restart=always --env-file .env --name=gramtion ghcr.io/lromul/gramtion:0.0.2
    ```

* Open logs 

    ```bash
    docker logs -f gramtion
    ```

* Stop container

    ```bash
    docker stop gramtion
    docker rm gramtion
    ```
